        This is an early version of a neural <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis>
        speech synthesis system</a> for <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto>Esperanto</a>.
        This site for now mostly exists to show my current state of progress.
        This is still an early test, the voice quality will likely improve in the future.
        I also hope to add more voices and also female voices (this might become possible
        with the next Common Voice dataset release; currently I don't have enough female
        speech recordings; if you identify as female or non binary and want to donate
        your voice for this project please email me speech_generation[at]protonmail.com).

        All text entered in the website is currently stored for
        further improvement, therefore please don't enter any
        sensitive information into this website.
    part3: >
        Please be considerate in the amount of audio you generate. I
        recommend not generating more than ~50 sentences per day.
        (If you still need to do that please send me an email first)

        If you can afford to support this project financially or
        have close ties to an organization who could sponsor this
        project to ensure it's long term existance please send me an

        I'm also working on a speech to text system for Esperanto, a
        demo of which you can see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEeahcdNZ2M">
        here</a>

        Thanks to the <a href="https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en">
        Mozilla Common Voice Project </a>,
        it's contributors and the speaker of the original
        recordings for providing the audio. Also thanks to
        <a href="https://twitter.com/stergro">Stefan</a> for
        getting me interested in building Esperanto speech systems
        as well as supporting me in endless chat discussions and
        <a href="https://twitter.com/sav22999">Sav</a> for making
        the Common Voice Android app as well as everyone else who
        helped building the app and to everyone who responded
        offered to donate their voice so far after my initial reddit
        post about Esperanto speech synthesis back in March.
